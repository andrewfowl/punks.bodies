# (Pixel) Punk Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.) and Answers


## Q: Am I allowed to create and sell my own [Crypto] Punks?

**A:** I am not a lawyer but let's get real. Yes, in a free world you can of course create and sell your own punks.

About the originals by LarvaLabs - the first question is: Are they really original?  See the [**Blockheads (Anno 2013)**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/pixelart-howto/tree/master/blockheads) and I am sure there are many more.

I'd say you cannot copyright a trivial 24x24 pixel image - there might be a point about the complete collection (like you can copyright a complete database but not individual facts).

Anyways, the irony is of course the name, that is, CryptoPunks.

The punk ethos is that you do-it-yourself and you don't care what others think (oh, that looks so cheap and so on).  And crypto - of course - is by definition a law-less "decentralised" fraudster paradise where anything goes. And yes, selling 24x24 pixel images by itself is a fraud and shame on the LarvaLabs fraudsters¹ for not stopping the madness but raking in the millions $$$ from greater fools.

¹: Please remember - a blockchain token - is nothing special - it is just a signed database entry. Yes, the emperor has no clothes. See [**Come See My Collection**](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/bitcoin/2021-04-02-come-see-my-collection.html)  from a more honest computer scientist  (shame on Matt Hall and John Watkinson both have computer science university degrees - so they for sure know what they are doing and how a database works).

## Q: Can anyone explain the "Flex-How-Stupid-AND-Rich-I-Am?!"  [Crypto] Punks?  Why pay million dollars for a free public domain 24×24 pixel image? 

**A:**   

  As a public service announcement let's restate what might get lost in the programming minutiae:

  Yes, CryptoPunks is a con-artist financial fraud. The Emperor has no clothes. Let's start with what you "own" when you buy a CryptoPunk [token].

   The only thing that you "own" is the private 256-bit integer number that you create (for free) on your own computer and that you MUST keep secret, that is, your private key.

   From the 256-bit integer number (private key) you get a "free" public key and public Ethereum account  - the account gets derived (calculated) via Elliptic Curve Cryptography from the public key.

   Anyways, if you now buy a CryptoPunks token via the CryptoPunksMarket contract / service - all you get is an entry in a database that you are now a "certified" CryptoPunks owner and you get assigned an index number (between 0 and 9999).   That's it.

  There's nothing decentralized or trustless.  You have to trust the central issuer LarvaLabs that you own a picture / image of punk.

   And the fact is that LavraLabs actually tell you that you don't. To quote:

>  redraw "by hand" in minutes], to which we [claim to] own exclusive
> copyrights, can be found at: https://larvalabs.com/cryptopunks

  And so on and so forth. What's your take?
